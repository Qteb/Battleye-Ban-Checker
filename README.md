# Battleye Ban Checker
This tool scans steam config file for steam ids and check if they are banned. :sob:

Just because your steam id isn’t banned doesn’t mean your key isn’t banned (bans before arma dropped GameSpy).

Supports:
* Arma 2/3/SA
* DayZ

## Minimum Requirements
* Windows Vista SP2 or Windows Server 2008 SP2 and above.
* .NET 4.5.1
